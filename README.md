## Personality Types Predictor

*Personality* is a fundamental basis of human behavior, it affects the interaction and preferences of an individual. *Social networks* have become a prominent platform for opinions and thoughts, this indicated that there is a strong correlation between the personality of users and the way they behave on social networks. 

In this work we explore the use of **Machine Learning** techniques to infer **personality traits** of a user from Facebook status updates. 

For **personality recognition**, the models were trained for each of the five personality traits, given by the **Big-5** personality classification, using **LIWC** (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) characteristics and were compared different classification methods, such as *Logistic Regression, RandomForestClassifier, Mul tinomialNB, GradientBoostingClassifier, SVC, LinearRegression, Ridge,SGDRegressor*; the performance of the systems was measured using precision.
